/**
 * Drops status-effect particles on the client, so the swirls never become visible particles.
 *
 * <p>The target is {@code ClientLevel.doAddParticle}, the single private method both public
 * {@code addParticle} overloads delegate to. Hooking it instead of the overloads means the limit
 * flag path and the plain path are both covered by one injection, and no future overload that
 * also funnels here can slip past.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only the two status-effect types are filtered. {@code ENTITY_EFFECT} is the coloured swirl a
 * living entity emits while a potion is active — the one that flies in front of the camera after
 * drinking something; {@code INSTANT_EFFECT} is the burst an instant potion or a splash produces.
 * Everything else (fire, smoke, splash water, explosions, redstone) is passed straight through.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is purely visual. The effect data lives on the entity and is read by the server and by
 * the client's own effect handling; neither is touched, so duration, amplifier and every gameplay
 * consequence of a potion stay exactly as they were.</p>
